Test file for debug output and basic arithmetic operations.

This example demonstrates simple variable assignment and arithmetic
operations in Carrion. It shows how to define variables, perform
addition, and display results using the print function. This file
is commonly used for testing the interpreter's basic functionality
and debugging output capabilities.
```

# Define two integer variables for arithmetic testing
x = 5
y = 10

# Calculate the sum of the two variables
sum = x + y

# Display the result to verify correct operation
print(sum)
