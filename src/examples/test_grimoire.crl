```
Example demonstrating custom grimoire definition and object-oriented programming.

This script shows how to define custom grimoires (classes) with methods,
instantiate objects, and call methods with parameters. Also demonstrates
type conversion from strings to integers and method parameter passing.
```

# Define a custom grimoire with a method for arithmetic operations
grim Example:
    ```
    Simple arithmetic method that adds two numbers together.
    Demonstrates basic method definition with multiple parameters.
    ```
    spell example_method(x, y):
        return x + y

# Convert string values to integers for arithmetic operations
a = int("10")
b = int("10")

# Create an instance of the custom grimoire
example_obj = Example()

# Call the grimoire method and display the result
print(example_obj.example_method(a,b))
