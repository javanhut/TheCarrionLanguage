Example demonstrating conditional statements and control flow in Carrion.

This script showcases the if-otherwise-else conditional structure unique
to Carrion, along with increment/decrement operators and string concatenation.
Demonstrates how different conditional branches execute based on variable values.
```

# Initialize a test variable for conditional evaluation
x = 3

# Demonstrate Carrion's if-otherwise-else conditional structure
if x < 1:
    # Increment and display if x is less than 1
    x++
    print(str(x) + "\n")
otherwise x >= 2:
    # Decrement and display if x is greater than or equal to 2
    x--
    print(str(x) + "\n")
else:
    # Default case for any other values
    print(str(x) + "\n")
