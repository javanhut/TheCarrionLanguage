Example demonstrating while loop functionality and increment operations.

This script shows how to create counting loops using while statements
combined with increment operators. Demonstrates basic iteration patterns
commonly used for repetitive operations and counter-based loops.
```

# Initialize a counter variable
x = 0

# Create a counting loop that runs 5 times
while x < 5:
  # Display the current counter value
  print(x)
  # Increment the counter for next iteration
  x++
