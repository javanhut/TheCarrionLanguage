Example demonstrating recursive function implementation for factorial calculation.

This script implements the classic factorial algorithm using recursion,
showing how functions can call themselves with modified parameters.
Demonstrates base case handling and recursive mathematical operations.
```

# Define a recursive factorial function
spell factorial(n):
    ```
    Calculates factorial of n using recursive algorithm.
    Base case: factorial(0) = 1
    Recursive case: factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
    ```
    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: n times factorial of (n-1)
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Calculate and display factorial of 5 (should be 120)
print(factorial(5))
