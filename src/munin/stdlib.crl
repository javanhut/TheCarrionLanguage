Main standard library module for Carrion Language

This serves as the entry point for the Munin standard library, providing
core functionality and utility functions that form the foundation of the
Carrion programming experience.

The Munin standard library is named after Odin's ravens Huginn and Munin,
which represent thought and memory respectively. This naming reflects the
library's role in providing both computational capabilities (thought) and
data management features (memory).

This module contains essential utility functions including:
- Version information and system details
- Module discovery and documentation
- Help system for interactive assistance
- Core library initialization functions
```


```
Provides interactive help information for users of the Carrion language.

This function returns a comprehensive help message that guides users through
the available system functions and how to access more detailed information
about the language and its capabilities. It serves as the primary entry point
for new users to discover the available functionality.

Returns:
    A formatted string containing help information about version checking,
    module discovery, and accessing the interactive help system.
```
spell help():
  return "To check current version use: version() function\nTo check Available modules use: modules() function.\nTo run interactive helper functions type: help in interactive repl"

```
Returns version information for the Carrion language and Munin standard library.

This function provides version details for both the core Carrion language
interpreter and the Munin standard library. This information is essential
for debugging compatibility issues and ensuring proper feature availability.
The version string follows semantic versioning principles.

Returns:
    A string containing the current version numbers for both Carrion language
    and the Munin standard library in a human-readable format.
```
spell version():
    return "Carrion Verison 0.1.6 Munin Standard Library 0.1.0"

```
Returns detailed information about all available modules in the Munin standard library.

This function provides a comprehensive overview of all modules included in the
Munin standard library, along with brief descriptions of their primary purposes.
This serves as a quick reference for developers to understand what functionality
is available without needing to consult external documentation.

The modules cover a wide range of functionality from basic data type operations
to system-level interactions, providing a complete foundation for Carrion
applications.

Returns:
    A formatted string listing all available modules with descriptions,
    organized in a readable tabulated format for easy reference.
```
spell modules():
  return "Munin Standard Library\nAvailable modules:\n\tArray: Array manipulation\n\tBoolean: Boolean operations\n\tString: String operations\n\tInteger: Integer utilities\n\tFloat: Float utilities\n\tMath: Mathematical functions\n\tFile: File operations\n\tOS: Operating system interface\n\tDebug: Debug utilities"
